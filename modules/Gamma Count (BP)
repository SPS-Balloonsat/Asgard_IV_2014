/* Please bear in mind that I have little experience with Arduino.
I may not have used the most perfect or advanced methods when making this.
However, i have tried to learn as much as I could before writing this, which is why I took a while to do it.
This may be a little bit buggy and is subject to testing.
In addition, I do not know the board. Some pins may need to be changed.
