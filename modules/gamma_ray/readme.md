Gamma Ray detector
==================

This is for a custom designed and built gamma ray detection board, closely based on a [Maxim application note](http://www.maximintegrated.com/app-notes/index.mvp/id/2236)

The system is intended to output a pulse each time it is struck by a gamma photon, although sensitivity may need to be tweaked a little bit.
