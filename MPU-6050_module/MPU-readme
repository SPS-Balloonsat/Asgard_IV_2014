The current idea is to base the code off Jeff Rowberg's i2cdevlib example code, as suggested there. That is under an MIT license, so there should be no issue. 
Currently the example_dmp6 folder contains the main MPU-6050_DMP6 folder contains the example files, and MPU6050-lib contains the full library, for reference.

The library functions are documented at: http://www.i2cdevlib.com/docs/html/class_m_p_u6050.html

See specification.md
